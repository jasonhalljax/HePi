## Healthcare Pipeline POC

This is a small healthcare pipeline project for me to practice and demonstrate skills.

Steps:
- Using Python, kick off a Synthea run to create a population of synthetic healthcare patients
- Load these patients into a HAPI FHIR server
- Pull resources that meet varying criteria into pandas Dataframes
- Perform analysis like care gap analysis, population health metrics, resource utilization patterns, etc
- Visualize the findings with Power Query along with PowerBI/Excel
